### Machine Learning on Telecommunication Site Data (Cell Towers – Iran)

---

### 📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning on anonymized telecom cell site data to discover patterns and make predictions. We apply clustering to group similar towers and classification to predict their behavior based on location and technical details.

---

### 🎯 Goals
- 🔍 Cluster similar telecom sites
- 🤖 Build ML models to classify sites
- 🗺️ Visualize sites

---

### 🛠️ Technologies
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, folium, plotly)
- Clustering: KMeans, DBSCAN, Agglomerative
- Classification: RandomForest, XGBoost
- Visualization: Plotly, Folium, Matplotlib
